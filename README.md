## Browser support
This datepicker have been tested with the following browsers/OS:

Chrome<br>
Firefox<br>
Edge<br>
Android<br>
IE: 9 and higher<br>
Safari: 7.1 and higher<br>
iOS: 6 and higher

However, these tests have not been extensive. More or less just trying the datepicker out, and see that it doesn't throw any console errors etc. If you're planning on using this in production, make sure that it runs smoothly in the browsers that you're planning on supporting.
